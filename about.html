<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is ALPHABOT, and I am an aspiring web developer with a strong interest in technology and digital creativity. I enjoy learning how websites are built and how ideas can be transformed into functional web pages that people can use every day.</p>
<p>I started learning HTML to understand the foundation of the web. Through web development, I have improved my problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and attention to detail. Each project I work on helps me gain more confidence and experience.</p>
<p>My goal is to become a skilled and professional web developer. I want to build clean, user-friendly, and responsive websites that provide real value, while continuously learning and improving my skills step by step</p>
